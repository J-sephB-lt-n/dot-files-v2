Launch a subagent in the background from the terminal using this command:

```bash
mkdir -p ./tmp_subagent_output &&
cursor-agent -p '<describe the task to the subagent here>' \
  --model claude-4.5-opus-high \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 & \
  echo $! > ./tmp_subagent_output/<your-chosen-subagent-name>.pid
```

Instruct the agent to write it's final findings in an information-dense markdown file in ./tmp_subagent_output/. The goal is maximum useful information in as few lines as possible.

You can find the process ID (PID) of your subagent inside the .pid file which you specified in the subagent launch command.

I may ask you at any future stage to check the status of your subagents, and you should use the following command to do so:

```bash
kill -0 '<your agent PID here>' 2>/dev/null && \
  echo 'subagent <your-chosen-subagent-name> is still busy.' ||
  echo 'agent <your-chosen-subagent-name> is finished.'
```
