# Guided Epic Requirements Documentation (with User-centered Checks)

We're planning a new epic (set of user features) to add to this codebase.

Please do the following:

1. Create the folder docs/current_epic/. If this folder already exists, then delete all of the existing files in it. Ask my permission first.
2. Add the folder docs/current_epic/ to the root project .gitignore file (ask my permission first).
3. Add the file docs/current_epic/dev_notes.md, with title "# Dev Notes - A central location for developers to share codebase knowledge in an unstructured format" as the first line of the document.
4. Elicit my requirements for this epic by asking me directed questions until my requirements are unambiguous. We need to include (at a minimum) the following:
   (for each, give me some varied options to get me going)

- epic title
- hypothesis statement (We believe that [capability] will result in [business outcome] which we will validate by observing [measurable signal])
- stakeholders
- scope (in and out)
- primary capabilities that the epic must deliver
- acceptance criteria
- non-functional requirements
- dependencies and risks

5. Write these requirements into a structured markdown document at docs/current_epic/epic_requirements.md
