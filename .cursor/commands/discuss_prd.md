# Discuss Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Talk me through the creation of a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the current project.
Continue to ask me questions until my intent is clear.

The PRD must contain the following sections:

- Overview: The basics of what you are building, including status, team members, and release date

- Objective: Strategic alignment, including organizational goals or initiatives

- Context: Customer personas, use cases, the competitive landscape, and other supporting material that will help the team develop a deeper understanding

- Assumptions: Anything that might impact product development positively or negatively (along with how you will validate this), and any known dependencies

- Scope: What is a current priority and what will not be included now, but might go in a future release

- Requirements: Details of what should be built

- Performance: Success metrics

- Open questions: Anything the team anticipates or is currently unsure of how to answer

On finishing each section of the PRD, append the new information into the file `PRD.md`.
