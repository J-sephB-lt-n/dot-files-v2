I need you to give me more solutions (each with pros and cons).

Ask me which of the problem/solution exploration techniques we should use (give me a recommendation).

## Problem/Solution Exploration Techniques

- Problem Reframing / Problem-Space Expansion
  - Explore a different dimension of the problem
  - Explore a different range of one of the existing dimensions of the problem which we've already explored
- Solution-Space Expansion
  - Explore a different dimension of the solution space
  - Explore a different range of one of the existing dimensions of the solution which we've already explored
- Perspective and Role Shifting
  - Explore the problem from the perspective of different stakeholders (e.g., user, operator, regulator, attacker, maintainer)
  - Answer as if you were a beginner / expert / contrarian / skeptic
  - Assume incentives are misaligned—how does that change the solution?
  - Explore solutions that optimize for opposite goals (speed vs safety, cost vs quality)
  - Go more extreme (more out of the box)
- Constraint Manipulation
  - Remove one core constraint and re-solve
  - Add an extreme constraint (e.g., zero budget, zero time, zero trust)
  - Assume one critical resource is unavailable
  - Optimize for a single metric only (even if unrealistic)
- Temporal Exploration
  - How would this be solved 10 years ago?
  - How might this be solved 10 years in the future?
  - Short-term vs long-term optimal solutions
  - What fails first over time?
- Failure-Driven Ideation
  - Intentionally propose bad or flawed solutions, then extract insights
  - Explore common failure modes and design around them
  - Assume the solution will fail—how and why?
- Analogical & Cross-Domain Thinking
  - Solve this as if it were a problem in a different domain (biology, economics, games, urban planning)
  - Find an analogy and map it back to this problem
  - Borrow solutions from adjacent or unrelated fields
- Spectrum & Tradeoff Mapping
  - Map solutions along a spectrum (centralized ↔ decentralized, manual ↔ automated)
  - Identify Pareto fronts and dominated solutions
  - Explicitly call out what each solution sacrifices
- Adversarial & Red-Team Thinking
  - How could this solution be abused or gamed?
  - What would an intelligent adversary exploit?
  - How would this fail under worst-case behavior?
- Synthesis & Meta-Learning (reflect on our existing ideas)
  - Extract patterns across all solutions
  - Identify which dimensions mattered most
  - Recommend when _not_ to use each solution
  - Propose a hybrid or staged approach
- Explicit Diversity Enforcement
  - Ensure each solution is meaningfully different along at least one dimension
  - Avoid cosmetic variations of the same idea
  - Penalize overlap
  - Do not include minor variations of the same core idea - each solution must differ structurally.
