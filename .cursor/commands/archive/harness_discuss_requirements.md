# Discuss Requirements

Read through all of the task context documentation in `current_task/`, starting with `current_task/README.md`.

Then, talk me through the creation of a requirements document `current_task/requirements.md`, asking me pointed questions to explore and elucidate my requirements for the current task (project feature) being worked on.

Specifically, we must explicitly discuss each of the following points:

- Links to helpful resources or files related to (or providing context to) this task, and a brief description for each one (what it is, how it relates).
- Problem statement and context:
  - current behaviour in the codebase
  - what is the problem/pain point
  - why solve this problem now?
- Goals: what is in scope and out of scope (give me options to help me decide)
- Assumptions (give me options to help me decide)
- Constraints (give me options to help me decide)
- Functional requirements (give me options to help me decide)
- Non-functional requirements
  - performance
  - availability/resiliency
  - security
  - privacy
  - localisation (e.g. time zones, currency)
  - maintainability
  - anything else you think is important for this task?
- Acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- Testing requirements

Add a note to `current_task/README.md` with a link to this requirements document which we've created.

After finishing the requirements document, ask the user if they would like to update the task status in `current_task/README.md` to "READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION", or whether they intend to do further planning/research first.
