# Partition Application Development into Epics

Read the following documentation:

- README.md
- docs/PRD.md
- docs/architecture_design.md (if it exists)
- docs/adr/\*.md

Now, help me to decompose the full development of this application into epics (large logical high level business requirement to be built).

Specifically:

1. Discuss with me how many epics we should partition development of this application into (and what the scope of each epic should be). Give me a few different options.

2. After we are both happy, write our final plan into `docs/epics.md`. Each epic in this document should have a status ['NOT_STARTED', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', 'BLOCKED']
